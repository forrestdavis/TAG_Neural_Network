# TAG_neural_network

This is a Neural Network Classifier for a dependency parser using trees from 
a tree adjoining grammar. The goal is to more accurately predict which
transition for the parser to take, using supertag information as well as 
particualar lingusitic properties of the trees. 

The Neural Networks used are created using Keras, a python library for 
easy implementation of Neural Networks, run with a Theano, another python
library for Neural Networks, backend.

Work in progress...

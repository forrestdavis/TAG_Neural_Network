# TAG_neural_network

This is a Neural Network Classifier for a dependency parser using trees from 
a tree adjoining grammar. The goal is to more accurately predict which
transition for a dependency parser to take, using supertag information as well as 
particualar lingusitic properties of the trees. 

The Neural Networks used are created using Keras, a python library for 
easy implementation of Neural Networks, run with Theano, another python
library for Neural Networks, backend.

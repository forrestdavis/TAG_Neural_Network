- MAKEFILE DEPENDENCY ISSUE NOT SURE WHATS HAPPENING
    : target was a generated file
    : need to add rule 
         $(FILES): out/%.npy: %.dependency
             action
         FILES = list of files
- add variable layers options
- add activation function options
- add node size options
- create flag system for keras model
    : add flag for train, test, or both
    : train must save
    : test must specify saved models
    : both has option of save
    : add predict option
    : help screen 
    : options for activation functions
    : variable layers 
    : path to data folder
    : somehow handle model with different features inputs
         - add generic fm and fann to numpy code from parser
         - use that and null properties of lists to create model
    : default values are best from experiments 
    : gold versus predicted
    : variable sentence size
- generic transform fann 2 numpy arrays
- maybe have model create data if not there 
- general idea right now is to remove seperate data makefile needs
     : want same structure so data can be accessed from different model
     types
- create CMake 
- generic fann generation for any sentence length
- mkdir and rmdir if not 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, or all in data formation
     : can do in python using os.mkdir()
- look at OrderDict in python so that you don't have to limit the types of
  data you can have i.e. want the data to always be the same order for
  getting train and predicted and test data so that you can run model on
  generic data folder

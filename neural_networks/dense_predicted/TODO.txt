- add variable layers options
- add activation function options
- add node size options
- create flag system for keras model
    : add flag for train, test, or both
    : train must save
    : test must specify saved models
    : both has option of save
    : add predict option
    : help screen 
    : options for activation functions
    : variable layers 
    : path to data folder
    : somehow handle model with different features inputs
         - add generic fm and fann to numpy code from parser
         - use that and null properties of lists to create model
    : default values are best from experiments 
    : gold versus predicted
    : variable sentence size
- maybe have model create data if not there 
- general idea right now is to remove seperate data makefile needs
     : want same structure so data can be accessed from different model
     types
- create CMake 
- mkdir and rmdir if not 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, or all in data formation
     : can do in python using os.mkdir()

- have a general fann 2 numpy in python that takes way to long need to
  explore c implementation of it or at figure out what is bottlenecking the
  python code

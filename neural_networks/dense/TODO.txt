- maybe have model create data if not there 
- general idea right now is to remove seperate data makefile needs
     : want same structure so data can be accessed from different model
     types
- create CMake 
- mkdir and rmdir if not 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, or all in data formation
     : can do in python using os.mkdir()
- need to add general fm file to fann2binary.c
